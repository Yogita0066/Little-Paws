<h3>Parrots</h3>

<h4>Parrots are special among pet birds because many species have the potential to be with you for your entire life. They also often outlive their owners. Parrots usually live longer in captivity than in the wild because they are less likely to encounter predators and disease while living in a home.</h4>
